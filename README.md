# SQL Pizza Sales Analysis

Analyzed transactional pizza sales data using SQL to calculate revenue, order trends, and product performance.

## What I did
- Total revenue, total orders, AOV, pizzas sold
- Daily and hourly order trends
- Sales share by category and size
- Top and bottom selling pizzas

## Tech
- T-SQL
- Azure SQL Database (execution environment)

## Insights
- Orders peak during lunch hours → staffing focus
- Medium size drives highest revenue share → promotion focus
- Bottom sellers underperform → remove/bundle/discount
